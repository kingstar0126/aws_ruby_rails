1.0.1 (2016-02-01)
------------------

* Feature - Gemfile - Replaced `rails` gem dependency with `railties`
  dependency. With this change, applications that bring their own dependencies
  in place of, for example, ActiveRecord, can do so with reduced bloat.

  See [related GitHub pull request #4](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-rails/pull/4).

1.0.0 (2015-03-17)
------------------

* Initial Release: Support for Amazon Simple Email Service and Rails Logger
  integration.
